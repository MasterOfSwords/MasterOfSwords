- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasterOfSwords. It's a codename, of course!
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding skills. Seems pretty obvious, really - I don't have anything unique to offer here, I'm afraid. In a career where I walk the line a lot between practical coding skills and team organisation and support, I felt I wanted to find myself a space to work on things unrelated to my career. Something engaging to me alone. Something worth making this line of my README much too long.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, and I'm seeing why some folks like it over the Java I learned before. I've got a grab-bag of skills in Linux navigation, SQL, React and others, too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well, nothing currently. This space is mostly to keep myself engaged with a personal project or two, presently.
- 📫 How to reach me? I don't know if GitHub HAS a comms function, currently, but I don't plan on connecting this directly with my main work details, so for now, I have no idea.
